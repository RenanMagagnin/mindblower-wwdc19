## Introduction ðŸ‘‹
This playground is a submission for the WWDC19 Scholarship and consists of a game called Mindblower, where the player shoots sticky grenades â€” which are affected by vector fields â€” in order to blow minds. To achieve this objective, the player needs to analyse each level, come up with a plan and shoot precisely.
